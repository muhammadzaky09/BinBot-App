[Chorus: Sexyy Red]
Bend that ass over (Baow), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees (Ho)
Hands on your knees (Ho), hands on your knees (Ow)
Shake that ass for Drake (Yup), now, shake that ass for me
Bend that ass over (Baow), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees
Hands on your knees, hands on your knees
Shake that ass for Drake (Yeah), now, shake that ass for me

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, I still got some love deep inside of me
No need to lie to me, I know you got a guy
He's not a guy to me
Just say goodbye to him, then take the ride to mе, ride to me
I still got some lovе deep inside of me
Please drag it out of me
You just might
Just might get that G-Wagon out of me
Please drag it out of me, please drag it out
Rollie gang, patty gang, rich baby daddy gang
I'm with Red like I'm at a Cincinnati game
Hood bitch, tat her gang 'fore she tat her name
Real bitch, held me down 'fore I had a name
Heard there's money on my head, what is that to me?
I put a hundred bands on him, he put a rack on me
We from two different worlds, but it's a match to me
The bend it over only time she turn her back on me (For real)

[Chorus: Sexyy Red]
Bend that ass over (Baow), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees (Ho)
Hands on your knees (Ho), hands on your knees (Ow)
Shake that ass for Drake (Yup), now, shake that ass for me
Bend that ass over (Baow), let that coochie breathe (Yeah)
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees
Hands on your knees, hands on your knees
Shake that ass for Drake (Yeah), now, shake that ass for me
